If you flip the genders (1 for female, 0 for male), the relationship flips-- being female increases the likelihood that a person will survive. Passenger class also has an inverse relationship to survival-- probability of survival decreases the higher the **value** of a person's passenger class (therefore, the lower their socioeconomic status)."
